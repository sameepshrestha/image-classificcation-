The data was first scraped from the google images using the webscraper.py. The scraped data was only an amount of 400 - 500 imaages. thus, augmentation techniquws were used inorder to augment the images to have a dataset of 8000 images for both cat and dog. The classification was then trained using pretrained Desnet201 model.
